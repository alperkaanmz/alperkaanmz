# Hi there, I'm Alper Kaan! 👋

### 🔭  About me
I’m a software engineering graduate  🎓 who enjoys turning ideas into code — and code into something people can actually use.

## 🌱 I'm currently learning
These days I’m exploring **Python, AI, and automation** 🐍🤖.  
Most days I’m prototyping small stuff: training a model, hooking up simple APIs, or building a tiny bot.  
I try things, read the logs, tweak, repeat 🔧. If it works, I ship it; if it doesn’t, I keep the lesson.

## 🚀 Goals for the Future
I’m especially interested in the mix of **AI + creativity** — building tools, apps, *vibe coding*, or whatever else sparks curiosity and solves real problems ⚡.  
I like working with people who are as excited about “what’s possible” as I am ✨.

Outside of code, I’m usually into sci-fi 🎬, games 🎮, or happily staying up till 3–4 AM researching whatever topic I’m obsessed with that week.

## 📫 Get in Touch
